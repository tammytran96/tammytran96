# Hi, I'm Tammy! 👩‍💻

## 🌻 About Me
I'm Tammy Tran, a passionate Software Engineer from the vibrant city of San Diego, California! With a strong inclination towards problem-solving, I thrive on challenging myself to embrace continuous learning, acquiring new skills, and nurturing personal development. My journey into the world of software development was inspired by the remarkable individuals I had the privilege of collaborating with, motivating me to take the leap and pursue it myself. Being hands-on and actively contributing to projects is where my true joy lies, and coding serves as my gateway to the captivating realm of technology.

Beyond coding, I find enjoyment in watching sports and planning my upcoming travel adventures. These hobbies provide the perfect balance to my tech-oriented pursuits, allowing me to unwind and gain fresh perspectives.
